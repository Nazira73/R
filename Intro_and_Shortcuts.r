# We have 2 things
# 1. Basic R
# 2. R studio

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The first one is the basic version of R (Orignal R application) and 
# looks like DOS i.e the environment is not user friendly. It has only 1 windows
# i.e Console. To write code we need to create a script file 
# But even to run the code written in the script file we need to come back to 
# console and then run the code. This is not user friendly

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# R studio is a GUI. Interface to make R user friendly 
# R studio picks up R installed in our system. If we did not installed R then 
# nothing would be displayed on Console
# It has 4 windows
# 1. Code Editor(Script)
# 2. Console
# 3. Environmenet/ History/ Connections
# 4. Files/Plots/Packages/Help/Viewer

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# History stores maximum of approx 200 recent lines of code

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Packages
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Once we want to add any package then we can download it 
# These packages contains codes (n number of functions), and are available on 
# repository CRAN
# CRAN--> Comprehensive R archieve network
# repository is like someone has built the package and dumped all the built packages
# inside this repository
# R is open source. i.e anybody can develop there own packages for specific task
# and all others can just download any use it.(The packages written are checked
# by the R guys and if everything is fine then it gets uploaded on the R repository)
# To install the packages we need internet connection to connect to the repository
# of CRAN
# There is another option i.e package archieve, from there the download can be 
# done locally i.e we dont need a internet connection
# Few packages are built using R functions only but few are built using c++.
# if we kep on digging then ultimately we will reach to c++ only.
# most of the packages are user defined, very few comes with R (system defined) 

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Shortcut--> CTRL + Shift + c

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# To run CTRL + Enter
# To clear the console CTRL + L
